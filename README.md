# Booklet

A new standalone, extendable **parser-analyzer engine** for [Lookbook](https://lookbook.build). _Work in progress._

The aim is for Booklet to eventually replace the existing file parsing/analyzing code in Lookbook and thus provide a more robust foundation for future releases to build upon.

Additionally, Booklet is being developed as a standalone gem in part so that it can also be used as a springboard for building additional tools (CLIs, MCP servers etc) to help Lookbook integrate more seamlessly into a variety of Rails frontend development workflows.

> [!WARNING]
> Booklet is in a very early stage of development and is **not ready for public use.**<br>It is currently incomplete and will likely see many breaking changes before a stable release candidate is available.

## Aims and objectives

* Use common, tried-and-tested parser/transformer implementation patterns over custom workflows where possible.
* Implement the analyzing process as a series of small, incremental steps to aid comprehension and testabilty.
* Be backwards compatable with existing Lookbook parser behaviour as surfaced in the app (although underlying APIs and conceptual definitions may differ).
* Make it straightforward to customise and extend the processing pipeline using plugins/middleware.
* Minimise any 'special-casing' of core functionality over that provided by third party extensions.
* Do not have any dependency on Rails (outside of conveniences provided by the `ActiveSupport` gem).

## Development status

Booklet is a brand new project and is not yet ready for public use. 

The [issues list](https://github.com/lookbook-hq/booklet/issues) contains an (incomplete) set of work that is planned before an initial beta release will be made available. 

Issues specifically related to achieving compatability with Lookbook's current parser output are tagged with the `compatability` label and the [Lookbook compatability](https://github.com/orgs/lookbook-hq/projects/3) project board has been set up to track progress on this metric.

## Why is a new parser engine needed?

The first incarnation of Lookbook was just a simple set of view templates that made it easier to navigate around ViewComponent previews within a Rails app. It effectively delegated handling of everything else to the native ViewComponent preview system, which itself is fairly bare-bones, so there was no need for analyzing files or anything like that.

Lookbook progressed organically from that point into the much more general-purpose tool it is today, slowly adding features and functionality. Many of the new features _did_ require some file parsing and analysis so those steps were tacked on to the existing codebase, and now we are at a place where the parser-analyzer logic is really right at the core of how Lookbook works.

But the system was never really designed around the idea of it being a filesytem-based parser-analyzer pipeline. The consequences of this include:

* The codebase is much too convoluted and hard to understand, and it is difficult to track down where many of the processing steps actually take place. It's a black box which makes it hard for other people who want to contribute to the project to know where to start.
* The system does not allow for any modification of the underlying data by plugins (or via middleware of any sort) which greatly limits the ability of users to be able to customise Lookbook to their needs.
* It can be slow when dealing with a large number of files.
* It does not have good test coverage and the file parsing process has many unintentional and undocumented quirks.

Booklet has been created to address these issues (and many others) by implementing a 'proper' parser-analyzer pipeline that is designed from the ground-up to cater for Lookbook's current requirements and to act as a flexible foundation for building future functionality on top of.

## Usage

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Booklet is not yet ready for public use - these instructions are for illustrative purposes only at this point.
> See the [Development status](#development-status) section for more info.

### Installation

Add Booklet to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem "lookbooklet"
```

After running `bundle install` Booklet will be ready to use in your codebase.

### API

```ruby
tree = Booklet.analyze("path/to/files")

tree.issues.each do |issue|
  puts "#{issue.severity}: #{issue.message} (#{issue.node.path})"
end

previews = tree.grep(SpecNode)
previews.each do |preview|
  puts "#{preview.label}: #{preview.scenarios.count} scenarios"
end
```

## Implementation details

Booklet generates a **traversable tree of entity node objects** from an input directory of files, via a number of intermediate steps.

Each file in the directory is converted into a corresponding node type. Node types include:

* Folders
* Specs (i.e. [previews](https://lookbook.build/guide/previews))
* [Pages](https://lookbook.build/guide/pages)
* Assets

Content nodes (i.e. specs & pages) typically have child nodes that represent their parsed content. Content node types include:

* Scenarios
* Prose

The hierarchy of the nodes in the tree broadly reflects the grouping of input files into folders and subfolders within the root directory as well as parent-child entity-content relationships where present.

All tree mutations and transformations are performed by ['double dispatch'-style](https://www.bigbinary.com/blog/visitor-pattern-and-double-dispatch) node visitors.

### File processing pipeline

> [!NOTE]
> Most of the time you'll probably want to use higher-level API methods than those presented below. See the [API docs](#api) section for more info.

Booklet breaks up the processing of files into two main steps:

1. Entity tree _creation_
2. Entity tree _mutation_
  
#### 1. Entity tree creation

Booklet recursively scans the contents of the root directory and adds a corresponding entity node to the tree for each file and directory found.

For example `SpecNode` instances are added for all component preview class files (names ending in `_preview.rb`), `PageNode`s for all markdown files and `FolderNode` instances for all directories & subdirectories (see above for details on all available node types).

 By default this initial tree loading is handled byt the `Booklet::EntityLoader` class.

```ruby
entity_tree =  FolderNode.from("example/demo").accept(EntityLoader.new)
```

#### 2. Entity tree mutation

Once the basic tree of entity nodes has been created, node _visitors_ are then applied to perform tasks such as parsing file contents and generally 'building out' the skeleton entity node objects created in the first step. 

```ruby
entity_tree
  .accept(PreviewClassParser.new)
  .accept(FrontMatterExtractor.new)
```

* The `PreviewClassParser` visitor uses the [YARD parser](https://yardoc.org/) to extract annotations data from preview class files and creates and appends corresponding `ScenarioNode` and `ProseNode` children to the appropriate `SpecNode` instance.
* The `FrontmatterExtractor` visitor _(not yet implemented)_ extracts YAML-formatted 'frontmatter' from the contents of markdown files and updates the related `PageNode` instances with the parsed data.

Additional entity node vistors can be applied here as needed to make changes to the entity tree nodes before the finalised entity tree is returned for use by the calling code.

## Testing

## Acknowlegments

[Marco Roth](https://marcoroth.dev/)'s fantastic work on [Herb](https://herb-tools.dev/) (and my subsequent deep-dive into the world of ASTs) was been instrumental in sparking the initial idea for Booklet and for shaping its approach.

Booklet's double-dispatch style node visitor base class is based on the very nice [BasicVisitor](https://github.com/yippee-fun/refract/blob/main/lib/refract/basic_visitor.rb) class from the [Refract gem](https://github.com/yippee-fun/refract). 

In addition much of the original incarnation of Booklet's `Node` class was based on code adapted from the excellent [RubyTree](https://github.com/evolve75/RubyTree) gem.
