1. If I Were Looking For a Vehicle

I like seeing these two out in the wild. They got pretty bored here in the studio. They started making up weird slogans and stuff. They had some phrase they kept repeating, forming fixations upon. You can’t be exposed to all that contrived fox nonsense.

Let’s just say: I am really trying my best to keep things collegiate. Having never attended college, I can’t well say if every passage written chimes right with the stringent criteria which academia demands. I have university friends aplenty, some who tour the globe in their pursuits, and I try to inflect my voice with just their blend of high culture.

Sometimes I applaud myself for going beyond the work of my educated friends—only in quiet corridors, we never butt heads publicly—because I have actually subscribed to a school of thought while they are still in their books, turning and turning.
